      <section class="reflection">
        <h3>Part 5: Written Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Before approaching this assignment, I thought I already knew which dimensions I would choose. I had concrete ideas for more tangible and physical dimensions that I could design 5 distinct pieces for. However, after taking time and effort to process and diagram this assignment and do ample research on what dimensions mean, I realized that my earlier ideas were too rigid and concrete. This exercise helped me see that interaction design is not limited to the physical or material, but extends to emotional, cognitive, sensual, and memory-based dimensions as well. By focusing on less visible aspects based purely from my own experiences, I was able to understand more how design can shape so many factors of our lives beyond just the surface.
            <br>
            I think using personal experiences as the basis of each of my dimension helped me understand how experiences truly work in the human mind. Everyone has unique experiences and feelings surrounding some event, and emotions play a big part in influencing how we perceive it, highlighting the importance of human-centered design. Exploring each of my chosen dimensions allowed me to see how design can highlight qualities of life that are intangible and unexpected across multiple layers of interaction.
